# Shared Packages

Place shared code here to keep the frontend and backend aligned:
- UI components (design system, primitives)
- Validation schemas and TypeScript types for API contracts
- Utility helpers (logging, formatting, feature flags)

Each package should have its own `package.json` and tests. Prefer small, focused packages over one large catch-all.
