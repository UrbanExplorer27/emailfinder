# Backend Service (placeholder)

This will host the server for:
- Email verification API integration
- Clerk authentication + webhooks
- Stripe billing + webhooks
- Internal API consumed by the web app

Suggested tech: Node.js (Express/Fastify), TypeScript, tRPC/REST, Prisma (if we add a DB), and a tests folder from day one.
