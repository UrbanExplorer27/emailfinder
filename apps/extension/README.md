# Email Finder Chrome Extension (Workspace Scaffold)

This workspace is reserved for the Chrome extension. Planned behavior:
- When on a LinkedIn profile, the extension pre-fills the person’s name and company domain.
- User clicks “Find email”; extension calls the app’s API, waits for the result, and shows the email with a confidence label.
- Provides Copy and “Save to list” actions; consumes credits only if an email is found.

Current status: scaffold only. Add your preferred tooling (Vite/webpack) and build script here.
